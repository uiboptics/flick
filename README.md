Flick is a general radiative transfer modeling framework  

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

This project depends on the following lools and libraries:

### Required:
- **C++20-compatible compiler** â€“ e.g., g++ or clang++
- [Eigen](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen.git) (MPL 2.0) â€“ Included as a Git submodule


### Optional:
- **Python + matplotlib** â€“ For optional plotting scripts

---

## ðŸ”§ Building the Project

### Step 1: Clone the repository with submodules

```bash
 git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/uiboptics/flick.git  

### Step 2: Enter directory and compile
```bash
 cd flick
 make






Clone from GitHub with:  
 git clone https://github.com/uiboptics/flick.git  

For macOS and Linux:

 enter the flick directory  

 run 'make' to compile, build, and test  

 run 'flick help' for further documentation and usage examples  

You will need to have a c++ compiler (e.g. clang++ or g++) already installed.
